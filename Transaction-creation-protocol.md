# Transaction creation protocol

The process of creating transactions in Beam (and other MimbleWimble currencies) is interactive.
In order to create a new Beam transaction, the sending and receiving wallets have to communicate with each other. During this negotiation they may exchange a wide range of parameters which should allow to create the transaction they need. As a result, the protocol between wallets should be extendable.


## What is a transaction in Beam?
Any Beam transaction should contain the following:
* List of input UTXOs (Inputs), they have to present in blockchain
* List of newly created UTXOs (Outputs) and rangeproofs for each output
* Explicit excess (offset)
* Kernel

### Transaction Kernel consists of (at least) the following:
* Blinded excess 
* Transaction fee
* Minimal and Maximal height values. These values allow to control the time in which the transaction is valid. Node will not accept a transaction if its height is lower than minimal height and greater than maximum height
* Signature. This is a Schorr’s multi signature which signs all the values listed above

### A Simple transaction flow.
Let’s say a **Sender** wants to make a payment to a **Receiver**.
* **Sender** and **Receiver** have to agree about `amount` and `fee`.
* **Sender** selects `inputs` which allow to pay `amount + fee`. If the sum of 'inputs' is greater than `amount + fee`, **Sender** also creates output for the change. **Sender** creates overall _blinding excess_ value `blindingExcess_S` and `offset_S`
* **Receiver** creates output for given `amount` and calculates _blinding excess_ `blindingExcess_R` and `offset_R`
* Both sides should generate _nonces_ `nonce_S` and `nonce_R` respectively.
* Both sides should pass each other public forms of excesses:
  * `publicNonce_S = nonce_S*G` and `publicNonce_R = nonce_R*G` – public nonces
  *  `publicExcess_S = blindingExcess_S*G` and `publicExcess_R = blindingExcess_R*G` – public blinding excessed
* Both sides have to calculate 
  * total blinding excess: `X = publicExcess_S + publicExcess_R`
  * total public nonce: `K = publicNonce_S + publicNonce_R`
* Both sides have to calculate Schorr’s signature challenge:
   * `e = H(K|M)`, where M is a signed message, it calculates from kernel and it includes X, fee, min height and max height
* Both sides calculate and pass to each other partial signatures:
  * S: `partialSignature_S = publicNonce_S + e*publicExcess_S`
  * R: `partialSignature_R = publicNonce_R + e*publicExcess_R`
* Final signature is calculated: `signature = partialSignature_S + partialSignature_R`

## Wallet-To-Wallet protocol
The protocol itself consists of only one message. It should allow to implement all the required scenarios and transaction types. Also, this message can be encapsulated and passed to other part by using different means: as a direct message sent over a p2p connection or an indirect message sent using secure bulletin board system (SBBS) and others.

## SetTxParameter
Transfers a pack of transaction’s parameters from one wallet to another. This message may initiate a new transaction. 

-	`WalletID m_From` – the address which wallet wants to use for responses, used when sending messages over **SBBS**. `WalletID` is packed 8 bytes of BBS channel and 32 bytes of wallet’s public key.
-	`TxID m_TxID` – unique 16-byte transaction identifier. Generated by transaction initiator.
-	`TxType m_Type` – transaction’s type like `Simple, AtomicSwap` etc. This field is used to create new transaction object, when this message is the first in a line, or for verification purposes.
-	`std::vector<std::pair<TxParameterID, ByteBuffer>> m_Parameters` – vector of pairs of transaction’s parameters. Each parameter is a pair of ID from range [0...255], and value represented as a raw bytes buffer. ID values are separated in two parts: private and public (ids below `PrivateFirstParam == 128` are private). Public parameters come from outside and they are not allowed to be overridden. Private parameters do not have limitations.

## Example: Simple transaction

Simple transaction is a payment from Wallet A to Wallet B, with a change UTXO and fee. 

### Wallet A sends an invitation.

```javascript
SetTxParameter
{
    m_From: XXXXXX // ID of the wallet to receive the response.
    m_TxID: 651798 // newly generated random identifier.
    m_Type: TxType::Simple,
    [
        {TxParameterID::Amount, amount},
        {TxParameterID::Fee, fee},
        {TxParameterID::MinHeight, minHeight}, 
        {TxParameterID::MaxHeight, maxHeight}, 
        {TxParameterID::IsSender, false}, // flag to distinguish the sender from the receiver.
        {TxParameterID::PeerInputs, inputs}, 
        {TxParameterID::PeerOutputs, outputs},
        {TxParameterID::PeerPublicExcess, publicExcess}, 
        {TxParameterID::PeerPublicNonce, publicNonce},
        {TxParameterID::PeerOffset, offset}
    ]
}
```
* `minHeight `- if height of the blockchain is less than the specified value, the transaction will not be taken into account.
* `maxHeight` - if height of the blockchain is greater than the specified then node will reject created transaction.
* `inputs` - vector of inputs (commitments) chosen by sender.
* `outputs` - vector of change outputs, created by sender.
* `publicExcess` - public form of sender’s excess calculated from blinding factors of inputs and change output.
* `publicNonce` - sender generates secret nonce, this is its public value.
* `offset` -  offset value, randomly taken part of change output blinding factor.



### Wallet B confirms invitation.
Wallet B creates an output for the received amount and generates a nonce to sign transaction.
```javascript
SetTxParameter
{
    m_From: YYYYYY  // the ID of the wallet to receive response.
    m_TxID: 651798, // the same ID as sender.
    m_Type: TxType::Simple,

    [
        {TxParameterID::PeerPublicExcess, peerPublicExcess},
        {TxParameterID::PeerSignature, receiversPartialSignature},
        {TxParameterID::PeerPublicNonce, publicNonce}
    ]
}
```
* `peerPublicExcess` - receiver’s public excess, calculated from the output’s blinding factors.
* `receiversPartialSignature` - receiver’s part of Schnorr multi signature.
* `publicNonce` - public form of nonce for signature.


### Wallet A confirms the transaction. 
If the receiver’s signature is valid, it calculates its part of signature
```javascript
SetTxParameter 
{
    m_From: XXXXXX // chosen wallet’s ID to receive response.
    m_TxID: 651798, 
    m_Type: TxType::Simple,
    [
        {TxParameterID::PeerSignature, sendersPartialSignature}
    ]
}
```
`sendersPartialSignature` - the calculated signature of the sender

Now wallet B has all data required to create transaction and send it to a node.

### Cancellation or error

If any of the participants wishes to interrupt the process for any reason, it sends the following message:
```javascript
SetTxParameter 
{
    m_From: ZZZZZZ // chosen wallet’s ID to receive response
    m_TxID: 651798, 
    m_Type: TxType::Simple,
    [
        {TxParameterID::FailureReason, reason}
    ]
}
```
`reason` - 32 bit code of failure reason
