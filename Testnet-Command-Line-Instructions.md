**Welcome to Beam Testnet 1**

Node binaries can be downloaded from the Beam website (http://beam-mw.com/downloads) or from Github (https://github.com/beam-mw/beam-builds/tree/master/testnet/release)

You can run the node with command line options, or modify the attached config file. Once you start the node it will create a node.db file in the same folder. This file will store internal state of the node.

**Reporting issues**

In case you encounter any problems, please report them via Ðµmail to testnet@beam-mw.com or open a github ticket at https://github.com/beam-mw/beam

Attach archive with logs, configuration file and command line parameters to allow effective investigation of the issues.

**Running a node**

Node parameters can be either passed through command line or written in the beam-node.cfg file.

Example:

*./beam-node --peer 138.68.130.189:8101 --wallet_seed 111 --mining_threads 1 --file_log_level debug*

The --peer parameter specifies a comma separated list of peers that the node will initially connect to. After the connection is established, the node will get an updated list of peers from the nodes, along with peer ratings and from that moment it will manage the connections on its own.

--wallet_seed - is a secret key for the wallet that will connect to this node to collect mining rewards (if the node is mining)

--mining_treads - specifies the number of CPU cores utilized for mining. If set to 0, node acts as validating node only.

--file_log_level - allows you to see that is going on behind the scenes.

Upon first launch, the node will download current blockchain history in batch mode as one large macroblock. After the initial sync is complete, the node will continue to sync blocks and individual transactions from the current blockchain Tip and onwards. This can be seen in the log entry:

*My Tip: 24704-f2ab414ba6430d85*

**Running a command line wallet**

After extracting the wallet binary to a folder, first we need to initialize the wallet by running:

*./beam-wallet --command init*

You will be prompted to provide wallet password and then seed. If you are using a miner node, the seed should be the same as was set in the --wallet_seed flag of the node


**Printing wallet information**

To get the information about the status of the wallet, run:

*./beam-wallet --command info -n 127.0.0.1:10000*


**Receiving Beams**

To receive beams we need to start a wallet in a listening mode by running:

*./beam-wallet --command listen -n 127.0.0.1:10000;*

After entering the password, wallet will print out the line similar to:

*WalletID 4a0e54b24d5fdf06891a8eaa57b4b3ac16731e932a64da8ec768083495d624f1 subscribes to BBS channel 9*

This show the SBBS address the wallet is listening on. This address can be copied and sent to Sender.

**Sending Beams**

*./beam-wallet --command=send -n 127.0.0.1:10000 -r 77de6bd3de40bc58ab7e4fb68d5e0596fd1e72f3c4fb3eb3d106082d89264909 -a 11.3 -f 0.2*

To send Beams, use 'send' command with the following parameters:
-r <SBBS address of the receiver node>
-a <amount of beams to send>
-f <transaction fee>
