# Exchange integration guide (DRAFT)

## Getting binaries
First of all, you should decide on which network you want to play with Beam:
- `mainnet` - it's the latest released version and you can get binaries from the [official website](https://www.beam.mw/downloads), from [Github Releases](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/releases) or build yourself from the sources ([mainnet branch](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/tree/mainnet)).
- `testnet` - download from [Github Releases](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/releases) or build from the [testnet branch](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/tree/testnet).
- `master` - here you can test the latest changes we are working on, build it from the [master branch](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/tree/master).

Here are [detailed instructions on how to build project](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/How-to-build) for *Windows*, *Linux*, *Mac* platforms .
> Add `-DBEAM_NO_QT_UI_WALLET=On` command line parameter to the Cmake if you need only CLI version of the wallet without UI and QT5 library dependencies.

As a result you need 4 binaries: `beam-node`, `explorer-node`, `beam-wallet` and `wallet-api`.
 
## Initializing Wallet

To create a new wallet run the following command: 
 
`./beam-wallet init`  

and `wallet.db` will be created in the working folder.

Output exmample for `init` operation:

Generated seed phrase:

        IMPORTANT

        Your seed phrase is the access key to all the cryptocurrencies in your wallet.
        Print or write down the phrase to keep it in a safe or in a locked vault.
        Without the phrase you will not be able to recover your money.

```
You can also restore wallet with your `seed_phrase` if you've already had it.

`./beam-wallet restore --seed_phrase=<semicolon separated list of 12 seed phrase words>;`

Once wallet is initialised, you have to export your *Owner Key* (it will be needed in the future to start own node).

<summary>
More info about `owner key`
</summary>
The purpose of the `owner key` is to allow all nodes mining for you to be aware of all mining rewards mined by other nodes so that you would only need to connect to one node to collect all the rewards into your wallet. While in most other cryptocurrencies this is done by simply mining to a single address you control, in Mimblewimble it is not as simple since there are no addresses and the mining rewards should be coded with unique blinding factors which are deterministically derived from the `master key`, and then tagged by the single `owner key`.

Owner Key should be kept secret. Owner Key does not allow to spend coins, however it will allow to see all coins mined for you by all miners that use this Owner Ðšey.

## Starting a Node
Run the node with your _Owner Key_ and make sure it has completed the synchronization with the network:  

`./beam-node.exe --peer=eu-node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100 --key_owner=XPWoJ/ViEO1whRcYC1z/nylDH1C2lqLxpMYU0/AbqP67XI4sgYDkUIvJfUpMFjwdPYNz2A7PCHWo7c/kHHTZ2EDUNv2BJvQHb1KHZjLNZPFgV2wceHfzvCYIUF3cR9ADfVSBquTxEldipNgp`  

>Please, make sure you pass proper peer address for the current network you have chosen before.

## Starting Wallet API

With API you can 
* check current [wallet status (balance)](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#wallet_status)
* get all you [utxo](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#get_utxo)/[transactions](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#tx_list) list
* [create](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#create_address)/[verify](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#validate_address) address 
* [send coins](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#tx_send) and [cancel](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#tx_cancel) transactions
* make a [split of coins](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API#tx_split) - create a specific set of outputs with given set of values

There are two ways to send JSON RPC commands to the API, 
* using TCP socket 
* via HTTP calls. 

With TCP you can hold only one connection, send JSON commands separated with `\n` symbol and receive callbacks from the API, in the one hand it's more flexible but a bit difficult to implement in the other hand. 
With HTTP you can do POST requests using CURL.  

So, to start API with HTTP support use the command: 
 
`./wallet-api --node_addr=x.x.x.x:port --api_use_http=1`  
where `node_addr` is your node address and port.

Here is detailed [wallet API documentation](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Beam-wallet-protocol-API).

## Starting Node Explorer API

With the *Node Explorer API* you can get information about current chain state and blocks using simple GET requests.

To run explorer use the command: 
 
`./explorer-node.exe --peer eu-node01.mainnet.beam.mw:8100 --api_port=8080`

>Please, make sure you pass proper peer address for the current network you have chosen before.
